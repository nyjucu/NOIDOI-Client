# About
With this project I started the journey into the world of Object-Oriented Programming and Databases.
# What Was Used
## Languages
Java and SQL
## API
Java's AWT

PostgreSQL
# Scope Of This Application
The application is a client in which you can create your personal account. With this account, you can download games developed by NOIDOI Studios. You can also edit your account.
# Register Is Not Working On Your Machine
Access to database may not always exist, since the server is closed most of the time. For that you have to register with the admin account.
